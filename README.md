My personal programming setup. Not intended for general use but shared for anyone interested.

Because this is my personal setup, I will make changes to the project for the sake of my own benefit without regard for how that may impact others using it. I plan on later developing a version intended for general use when I am less busy.

Because this was produced in a hurry, some of the code is sloppy and their might be bugs. When less busy, I intend to clean this up.

My setup depends upon the community repository commands.
